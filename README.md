I conducted this project while enrolled in the Data Analyst with Python career track on the DataCamp platform. Utilizing critical thinking, statistical analysis, and libraries like pandas, numpy, and seaborn, I answered several questions and identified areas for potential future research.

Key highlights:

    Focus: Demonstrating my Python skills and their application in analyzing educational data.
    Analysis scope: Standardized test performance in NYC public schools.
    Techniques: Statistical analysis and data visualization using Python libraries.
    Outcomes: Answering relevant questions and generating further research questions.
